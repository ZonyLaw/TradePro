        <p>Do you find yourself lost and not knowing what market direction is doing?</p>
        <p>This is a tool to help give you a sense of the direction at the hour. 
            It is trained on some key parameters like: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                MA20, MA50, MA100
            </li>
            <li>
                Bollinger Band
            </li>
            <li>
                market trend strength
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It will tell you whether the trend is mostly oscillating or trending in a particular direction.
             Often, we have many confirmation indicators, but how do we assign weights to them? This 
             machine model will help provide a better sense of this by examining historical data and 
             making those correlations.
