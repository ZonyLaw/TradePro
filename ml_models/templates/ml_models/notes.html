        <h1>Fears</h1>
    
       <ul>
        <li>If you take past lost you hesitate to do the good trade</li>
        <li>I seem to lose money when I chicken out but then some time I should cut my lost.</li>
        <li>If you are afraid of big movement of reversal, you always want to trade from the top. This could be wrong in some situation.</li>
        <li>If you doing contrarian because you are focus on the risk that it hit the high and saver to trade the opposite. Again this may not be the case. Almost 80% this never happens. </li>
        <li>Do only 0.1 trade, there is no point to trade 0.4 trade until you become good. 99% of the time you will loss at the 0.4 and 0.1 you can tolerate.</li>
        <li>Extreme point is good area to do reversal, but you always have the fear or don't trust your strategy.</li>
        <li>Long term trade, will most likely recover to the breakeven if you enter at the right point(e.g. extreme point)</li>
        <li>Japan made a big intervention back in 2022 so they don't do it often! This work a bit but trend continues upwards after.</li>
        <li>The situation in 2024 is it seems the rise of interest rates didn't help JPY because of the big gap between USD interest rate still persist and cutting rates are delayed.</li>
        <li>If in historical table, there are "buy buy buy" and "sell", then you could enter with caution as this could be a slight retracement.</li>
        <li>Volume in trend should generally be greater than 3000 and dimension in time. A weakening will allow opposite trade.</li>
