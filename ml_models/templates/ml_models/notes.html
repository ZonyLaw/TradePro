        <h1>Notes</h1>
    
       <ul>
        <li>If you enter on an impulse, you will likely enter at the wrong point.</li>
        <li>If you trade too often, you will loss in the long term.</li>
        <li>Stress arises when you don't know your strategy or not following it.</li>
        <li>Review your Risk and Reward.</li>
        <li>If oscillating, remember to take profit even it is small</li>
        <li>80% of the overnight trade you could have win if your profit is set to 10 -20 pips. Anything longer, you will be doing long term target.</li>
  
       </ul>

        <h1>Fears</h1>
    
       <ul>
        <li>If you take past lost you hesitate to do the good trade.</li>
        <li>Hoping things will turn around when you should cut your lost.</li>
        <li>Entering too early because there is a fear you lost the opportunity.</li>
        <li>If you are afraid of big reversal movement, then enter at extreme points. The chance this would be wrong is smaller if the timeframe is bigger where you take the extreme.</li>
        <li>If you doing contrarian because you are focus on the risk that it hit the high and saver to trade the opposite. Again this may not be the case. Almost 80% this never happens. </li>
        <li>Do only 0.1 trade, there is no point to trade 0.4 trade until you master your trade strategies. 99% of the time you will loss at the 0.4 and 0.1 you can tolerate.</li>
        <li>Long term trade, will most likely recover to the breakeven if you enter at the right point(e.g. extreme point)</li>
        <li>Japan made a big intervention back in 2022 so they don't do this often! Overall trend still continues upwards in the long run.</li>
        <li>The situation in 2024 is it seems the rise of interest rates didn't help JPY because of the big gap between USD interest rate still persist and cutting rates are delayed.</li>
        <li>There are two ways of looking at the historical table: One is lots of red values meaning invalidating the 4 hr trade; or there is oppotunity to become green values to fullfill prediction. Most likely it is oscillating between two points.</li>
        <li>Volume in trend should generally be greater than 3000. A weakening in volume need to be on the alert.</li>

       </ul>

        <h1>Stubborn beliefs</h1>

        <p>Some time it is hard to follow the trend which is one of the biggest driving force. There is always the fear that the high point has been reached and should reverse. However,
            when the trend starts and it is strong, it will continue going to the edge and beyond the limits. In 2023 to 2024 the USDJPY has a buy bias and even the JPY tries to turn it around
            it continues up. There doesn't seem to be any limits. The biggest driver was the gap in interest rates.
